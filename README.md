**A simple, easy to use, and visually pleasing past paper app**

## What is snapApaper?
snapApaper is a mobile application that uses your camera to scan a past paper code and instantly find your desired exam paper. The app allows you to store your papers, download multiple papers, and even time your papers, making it the simplest, easiest and best looking exam paper app on the play store.


## Why use snapApaper?
Stop wasting time and money browsing for your past papers online and switch to snapApaper instead! It's free for all students and teachers, and users can download multiple papers in one click. Rather than downloading 10 years of the same paper, you can do it all in one go with snapApaper.

## How does it work?
snapApaper utilizes Firebase's image recognition capabilities and Google's CameraX API to scan a past paper code and instantly find your desired exam paper. The app also uses web scraping to search for past papers online. Once the app finds the paper, it will be stored on our database and can be accessed anywhere and anytime as long as the user has an internet connection. If the user does not know the exam code, they can type it in our "Type" section or search for it by choosing from different options. Additionally, the app includes a feature called timeApaper, where users can time themselves while completing past papers to improve their knowledge and speed.
